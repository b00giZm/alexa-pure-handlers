ðŸŒŸðŸ¦„ Write pure handlers for the official [Node.js Alexa Skills Kit SDK](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs). ðŸ¦„ðŸŒŸ

One little flaw I found with the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js is, that it does encourage you to write handlers that are bound to an specific context and are therefore full of [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)). Side effects are bad, because they make your handlers less predictable and are much harder to test than [pure, functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) handlers.

Pure handlers are a good thing, because every dependency is provided explicitely through their arguments, and they can have a determined return value, which makes testing a breeze.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save alexa-pure-handlers
```

If you're hosting your skill on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/en/lambda/details/), please make sure to set your runtime to **Node.js 6.10**.

## Usage

Step 1: Write your pure intent handlers

```javascript
// inside handlers.js
const myIntentHandler = ({ attributes, t }) => {

  attributes.foo = 123;
  const emit = [':tell', t('MY_LOCALIZED_MESSAGE')]

  return { attributes, emit };
}

module.exports = { myIntentHandler };
```

Step 2: Wrap your handlers with `pure`

```javascript
const Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');
const pure = require('alexa-pure-handlers');
const { myIntentHandler } = require('./handlers');

exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context);

    alexa.registerHandlers(handlers);
    alexa.execute();
};

const handlers = {
  'MyIntent': pure(myIntentHandler) // This is where the ðŸŒŸðŸ¦„ happens
};
```

## Promises Support

Want to use [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) with your pure handlers? We got you covered there, too!

```javascript
const myPromiseIntentHandler = ({ attributes, t }) => {
  return fetch('http://api.example.org/unicorns')
    .then(res => {
      attributes.unicorns = res.json();
      
      return {
        attributes,
        emit: [':tell', t('OMG_UNICORNS')]
      };
    })
    .catch(err => {
      return {
        emit: [':tell', t('THE_INTERWEBS_EXPLODED')]
      };
    })
  ;
};
```
